# LVCMATHIDEAS

A modular archive of a collection of Mathematics Ideas to help with prime rituals, decimal cycles, and semantic overlays.  
This repository documents the mythic structure of primes through Python functions, geometric visualizations, and reusable audit templates.

## Modules
- 🔢 Prime Audit Engine
- 🔁 Decimal Segment Chaining
- 🔷 Hexagon Partitioning
- 🪐 Planetary Overlays
- 📊 Excel Templates for Modular Extraction

## Philosophy
Every prime is a mythic node. Every decimal cycle is a ritual trail. This repo seeks semantic closure through modular geometry and dialectic refinement.
